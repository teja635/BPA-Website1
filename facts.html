                                    <p>CNS depressants are most commonly known as sedatives as their main function 
                                         is to combat anxiety and sleep disorders. Although their intent is not harmful, 
                                         their effects on the body are highly addictive and have been abused by people 
                                         since the early days of the drug. Benzodiazepines and Barbiturates are the 
                                         two main categories of the CNS depressants that cause addiction and are thus 
                                         physicians limit their use of the two categories of the drug to short term use 
                                         only as long term use can cause the patient to be dependent and addicted to the drug. 
                                         Commonly known CNS depressants include  diazepam(valium), 
                                         alprazolam(xanex) and mephobarbital(Mebaral).

                            commonly used drugs and include Amphetamine, cocaine, and methamphetamine. 
                            They work by stimulating the release of neurotransmitters associated with 
                            reward and pleasure and give users feelings of increased energy, attention, 
                            heart rate, confidence, and increased respiratory rates leading the abuser to 
                            feel invincible. Common side effects of CNS simulates include lack of appetite, 
                            mood swings, depersonalization, weight loss, headaches, irritability, panic attacks, 
                            depression, and paranoia. Prolonged usage of CNS stimulants distances the user from 
                            reality gives them severe suicidal thoughts. As these drugs are used on multiple 
                            occasions, the liver will produce more and more soft endoplasmic rictulum to 
                            compensate for the extenuating amount of detoxifying that is required from the 
                            liver and thus the individual will have to take larger and larger doses of the drug 
                            in order to obtain that feeling that they first felt and in doing so increase the 
                            amount of damage they do to their body. Escaping the detrimental chains put forth 
                            by an individual’s intake of CNS stimulants is hard and long as the body will be 
                            accustomed to the high amount of reward neurotransmitters released by the brain 
                            when the drug is taken.

                        do not have as much of a detrimental effect on the body but rather pose as a 
                        health risk as they impair judgement and cause individuals see images and hear 
                        sounds that are non-existant. Hallucinogenics commonly effect the body by 
                        stimulating the sporadic release of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Research 
                        is still being done on the effects of hallucinogenics but current research supports 
                        the theory that they obscuring communication between the neurotransmitter systems 
                        that exist in the brain and spinal cord to regulate behavior and cause users to 
                        experience a feeling of euphoria and see and hear images and sounds that are 
                        nonexistent. Dissociative anesthetics like PCP take the effects of hallucinogenics 
                        and go a step further by making the user feel out of control and disconnected from 
                        themselves and the world around them. The effects of dissociative anesthetics cause 
                        symptoms comparable to those paranoid schizophrenia and when taken in higher doses can 
                        lead to respiratory distress and can lead to death.</p></div>

                    <div class="panel-body">Narcotic Analgesics are commonly taken to cope with pain. 
                        There effects are similar to that of Non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs i.e. 
                        advil but their effects are far more apparent. Specialists say that opioids can be 
                        taken by individuals as long as they are taken in moderation. This simple restriction 
                        is commonly ignored as the more opioid an individual takes the more pain relief they 
                        experience and this can in most cases have a cascading effect. The main problem with 
                        opioids is that they depress respiratory rates. When taken in large doses, an 
                        individual’s respiratory rate may slow down so much to the point of suffocation. 
                        This is the problem with most opioids as people who take the drug without adequate 
                        supervision by professionals may end up overdosing. Opioids work by acting on receptors 
                        located on neuronal cell membranes. By doing this they relieve pain signals coming from 
                        the peripheral nervous system to the brain. People suffering from chronic pain are more 
                        likely to develop dependence on opioids for pain relief. Professionals say that 
                        dependence of the drug is safe as long as the use is taking the allocated amount that 
                        they are supposed to. Tolerance, unlike with other drugs, is not a problem as long as 
                        the drug is not taken in exorbitant doses. The best action to prevent these drugs from 
                        causing damage is to listen to a professional supervisor on how much you should take 
                        and do not take more than the allowed amount you are prescribed.</div>

                        Inhalants hide in plain sight in a common household in the from of cleaning substances, 
                        and paint. Individuals can get high from these substances from inhaling the fumes 
                        from the substances. Inhaling such substances slows down brain activity or expands 
                        vessels and by doing so creates the high that people strive for. The high from these 
                        substances is short lived and thus it is common for users to inhale repeatedly. The 
                        repetitive inhalation of these substances can cause someone to lose consciousness and 
                        even die. Long term effects include damage to nerve fibers and damage to brain cells. 
                        Death from inhalants can be attributed to a multitude of causes including cardiac 
                        arrest, asphyxiation, suffocation, convolutions, seizures, coma, choking, and injuries 
                        due to lack of judgement. Due to their overbearing prevalence in a common household, 
                        the most common type of abuser are middle school students who have such substances 
                        readily available to them.
